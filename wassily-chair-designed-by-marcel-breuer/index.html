<p><strong>Wassily Chair Designed By Marcel Breuer</strong>, Breuer and Mart Stam used non-reinforced tubular steel to pretty much invent the 20th-century modern chair. At the Bauhaus he designed the Wassily Chair and the Cesca Chair which The New York Times have called some of the most important chairs of the 20th century. Inspired by the Constructivist principles of the De Stijl movement and the frame of a bicycle the Wassily chair distills the type to its bare essentials reflecting the Bauhaus proclivity for functionality and simplicity. Wassily Chair by Marcel Breuer The Wassily Chair also known as the Model B3 chair was designed by Hungarian-born modernist architect and furniture designer Breuer between 1925-1926.</p>
