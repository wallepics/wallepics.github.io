<p>To get the maximum ATP yield from molecules of glucose requires cellular respiration which and produce up to 36 ATP per glucose molecule. Respiration takes put in place every living cellular all of the time and all cells need to respire as a way to produce the energy them to require. Cellular respiration occurs in yeast as glucose is processed into ATP and carbon dioxide resulting in the puffing up of gas. Primary pigments and accessory pigments.</p>
