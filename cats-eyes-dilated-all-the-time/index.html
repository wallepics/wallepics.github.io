<p>If a cat s eyes are dilated all the time the situation might require a visit to the vet. I had a little panic moment that my cat always seems to have dilated eyes but thankfully I take pictures of him and I have pictures of him over the last 10 years and his eyes are always saucers. I dont know the maximum but ill use some of my cats as an example. A cats eyes being dilated can be a sign of illness elsewhere in their bodies. Why Do Cats Eyes Dilate Should You Be Worried Cats On My Mind.</p>
