<p><strong>Tropical Rainforest Plants Adaptations To Environment</strong>, Animal adaptations Many animals have adapted to the unique conditions of the tropical rainforests. The following adaptations allow plants to survive in the conditions of the rainforest. The bark on these trees is smooth to allow water to flow down to the roots easily. Adaptations help a plant to.</p>

<p>Especially plants on the forest floor they have to adapt to only getting 3 percent of the suns light. For example some trees such as the kapok grow very tall because of the competition for sunlight. There are many plants that thrive in the tropical rainforest biome. This is answered comprehensively here.</p>

<p>Plants in this biome have to adapt. Adaptations help a plant to. The soils here are nutrient poor and so the pitcher plants have evolved a carnivorous lifestyle to.

<p>Tree trunks - these are tall and thin to allow trees to reach the sunlight. Since very little light gets to this part of the rainforest these plants adapted to have very large leaves. It is important then that plants and trees be able to handle these challenges without getting sick rotting and dying.
