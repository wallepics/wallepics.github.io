<p>Student Council at the Foundations Academy 1050 Wyandotte Ave organized a food drive and collected 3055 items to be given to families and the Candace Williams Helping Hands Foundation for its Thanksgiving meal at the Friendly. Healthy non-perishable food is always great to donate to a food bank but is in even higher demand around the holidays. The items food banks want most during Thanksgiving. Theyre the items food pantriesand your neighbors in needcan really put to good use. Thanksgiving Food Drive Food Pantry Thanksgiving Food Basket Food Drive Flyer.</p>
