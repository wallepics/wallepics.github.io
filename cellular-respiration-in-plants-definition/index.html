<p>Aerobic Respiration Definition. Heterotrophs cannot synthesize their own food and rely on other organisms both plants and animals for nutrition. Autotrophs are organisms that can make their own food. Aerobic Respiration Definition. In this process of cellular respiration plants generate glucose molecules through photosynthesis by capturing energy from sunlight and converting it into glucose.</p>

<p>All living things use a form of cellular respiration to turn organic molecules into energy. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body cells including inhalation and exhalation diffusion of oxygen from the pulmonary alveoli to the blood and of carbon dioxide from the blood to the alveoli followed by the transport of oxygen to and carbon dioxide from the body cells. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from oxygen molecules or nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ATP and then release waste products.

<p>Cellular respiration is the process by which cells in plants and animals break down sugar and turn it into energy which is then used to perform work at the cellular level. Glucose is metabolized by the cell in a process called cellular respirationThe major steps or processes of cellular respiration are 1 Glycolysis 2 Krebs cycle and 3 Oxidative phosphorylationIn the initial step ie. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions which break large molecules into smaller ones releasing energy because.
