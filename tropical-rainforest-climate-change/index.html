<p>In doing so they produce that thick and beautifully dramatic cloud cover that reflects sunlight back to space. Current and Future Impacts to Tropical Rainforests. Yet with every passing year climate change cuts into tropical forests capacity to operate as a safe natural carbon capture and storage system. In general climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. Worldwide the degradation and destruction of tropical rainforests is responsible for around 15 percent of all annual greenhouse.</p>
