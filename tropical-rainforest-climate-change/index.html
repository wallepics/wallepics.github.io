<p>In doing so they produce that thick and beautifully dramatic cloud cover that reflects sunlight back to space. Current and Future Impacts to Tropical Rainforests. Yet with every passing year climate change cuts into tropical forests capacity to operate as a safe natural carbon capture and storage system. In general climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. Worldwide the degradation and destruction of tropical rainforests is responsible for around 15 percent of all annual greenhouse.</p>

There is no denying that the climate is not what it used to be and we are clearly feeling the effects what used to be considered a summer of the century is the new normal. It has become increasingly clear that this approach is the simplest most cost-effective way to keep carbon stored and fight climate change. It has been proven that small old forests undisturbed by the society are constantly sequestering removing carbon at a consistent rate and these tropical rainforests are more commonly located in the regions of Asia.
