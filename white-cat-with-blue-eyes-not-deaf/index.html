<p>Cats instead carrying the underlying cs Siamese dilution pigment gene can have blue eyes without deafness and it has been suggested that the presence of this gene explains why purebred white cats are less often. Eye color also has nothing to do with blindness. White kitten with blue eyes are often be associated with blindness and deafness. Im not sure exactly why that is but to venture an educated guess Id say that its probably because since white hair and blue eyes dont occur naturally in cats most cats with that colouring are the result of humans selectively breeding for cats with white hair and blue eyes over centuries. .</p>

<p>In those cats with eyes of another colour only 10-20 are likely to be deaf. But if the white cat has any other color of eyes or if it has one blue eye and one eye that is not blue then they usually are not deaf. As you can see the ectoderm forms the pigment cells and the eyes and ears. Of white cats with one blue eye about 40 pc are deaf in a minimum of one ear.
