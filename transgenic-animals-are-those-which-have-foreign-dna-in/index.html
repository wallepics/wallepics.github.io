<p>Transgenic mice have been engineered to express human antibodies which are superior to murine antibodies for use as drugs by introducing large segments of human DNA encoding human immunoglobulin genes and breeding these transgenic animals with strains in which the endogenous immunoglobulin loci are mutated. Recent evidence from the HGT technology confirms that transgenic DNA in GM crops and products can spread by being taken up directly by viruses and bacteria as well as plant and animals cells.
