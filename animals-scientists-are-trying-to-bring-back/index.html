<p>Hauser and his colleagues are trying to determine what sorts of thinking processes are unique to humans and what processes we share with animals. A group led by futurist Stewart Brand is spearheading a movement to try to use genetic technology to revive extinct species such as the woolly mammoth and the passenger pigeon. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the inoculation of the appropriate medium. Could we bring back those elm trees. We are a group of 12 and 13 year-olds trying to make a difference.</p>
