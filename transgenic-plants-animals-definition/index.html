<p><strong>Transgenic Plants Animals Definition</strong>, The seeds produced by these plants will inherit the new DNA. The first transgenic animals were only intended for genetic research to study the specific function of a gene and by 2003 thousands of genes had been studied. In the broad definition animals should be kept safe from some negative factors like thirst hunger pain suffering and psychological tensions.
