<p>Because electric car models are newer than their gas-powered counterparts many consumers are unaware of their options aside from the many recently announced carmakers going all-electric. Where the electric car has an advantage is with ongoing emissions. With a gasoline engine about 45s of the engines energy is either burned as waste heat or used to power the radiator to get rid of said waste heat. BEVs convert over 77 of electrical energy from the grid to engine power whereas ICEs convert only 12-30 of energy stored in gasoline.
