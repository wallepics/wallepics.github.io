<p>An ESA is considered to be a reasonable accommodation. They may require a pet deposit in order to rent. Emotional support animals are a relatively new form of emotional treatment and people are still learning the rules and regulations. An Emotional Support Animal ESA offers comfort and companionship to individuals who suffer from emotional or mental conditions.

<p>Importantly since there is no pet deposit for an emotional support animal special care must be undertaken to make sure the property damage can be repaired with the tenants security deposit before it is returned within 21 days of termination of the tenancy. The benefits of making your pet an ESA is that they are accepted at all housing rentals under the Fair Housing Act and are allowed in the cabin of airplanes under the Air Carrier Act. Tenants need to provide appropriate documentation to landlords and there can be legal consequences if they make false claims about their ability to have an ESA. The end goal is to bring changes to the law that will protect those who rely on emotional support animals for their well being and their rights when renting homes and travelling.
