<p>This is a natural reaction and cats will often assert themselves to warn dogs andor humans. Your cat may be hissing because it is feeling vulnerable andor out of place. Its more likely that your cat is upset because of the new cat entering the home and they are in a mood. Cats growl when they grapple with their prey.

<p>A growling cat can be a warning. Most felines do when they are scared or upset. They are feeling possessive and you need to stop encroaching on their territory. This behavior coupled with a growling or hissing means your cat is sending warning signals for either you or another animal to back away because it wants space.
