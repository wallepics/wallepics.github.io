Cellular respiration uses one glucose molecule to produce a total of 2 ATPs. The word glycolysis means to split sugar In glycolysis one molecule of glucose 6-carbon sugar is broken in half by enzymes in the cytoplasm producing 2 molecules of 3-carbon pyruvic acid or pyruvateSplitting a molecule in half sounds simple but glycolysis actually involves a series of steps that are. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells in plants and animals break down sugar and turn it into energy which is then used to perform work at the cellular level.</p>
