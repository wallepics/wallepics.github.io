<p>They work well since living organisms supply plants with. In this process of cellular respiration plants generate glucose molecules through. Aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration. In plants the glucose produced during photosynthesis is broken down in a series of enzyme-facilitated reactions to release energy in the usable form of ATP producing carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. Plants animals Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration Photosynthesis creates glucose molecules instead of eating this fuels cellular respiration in the plant cells which creates ATP which fuels plant growth and reproduction which provides carbohydrates to animals for their cellular respiration.</p>

<p>Cellular respiration consumes the products of photosynthesis and vice versa. During this process oxidation energy is captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ATP molecules. Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of animals plants and fungi and also in algae and other protists.

<p>Plants take part in respiration all through their life as the plant cell needs the energy to survive however plants breathe differently through a process known as Cellular respiration. While both plants and animals carry out cellular respiration only plants conduct photosynthesis to make their own food.

<p>Cellular respiration is of two main types depending on oxygen usage. Cellular respiration uses glucose and oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. It does not occur at any set time or at the same point in time. However plants have a reverse cycle of cellular respiration which produces oxygen as an end product.
