<p>Photosynthesis and respiration are reactions that complement each other in the environment. Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to break down food molecules to get chemical energy for cell functions. Both animals and humans breathe which is a step involved in respiration. Plants animals Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration Photosynthesis creates glucose molecules instead of eating this fuels cellular respiration in the plant cells which creates ATP which fuels plant growth and reproduction which provides carbohydrates to animals for their cellular respiration. Uses of Cellular Respiration Plants and animals both use cellular respiration to perform life functions on a daily basis.</p>

<p>This is called anaerobic respiration or fermentation. In plants the glucose produced during photosynthesis is broken down in a series of enzyme-facilitated reactions to release energy in the usable form of ATP producing carbon dioxide and water as byproducts. Thus cellular respiration is an essential process in living things and happens under various conditions. The reactants of cellular respiration are glucose sugar and oxygen these are taken in by animals and humans to produce energy.
