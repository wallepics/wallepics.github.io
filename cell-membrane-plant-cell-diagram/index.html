<p>Explore the structure of a plant cell with our three-dimensional graphics. Plant cells differ from other eukaryotic cells because the organelles present are different. An animal cell is a type of eukaryotic cell that lacks a cell wall and has a true membrane-bound nucleus along with other cellular organelles. Plant cells are eukaryotic cells with a true nucleus along with specialized structures called organelles that carry out certain specific functions. It does have additional structures a rigid cell wall central vacuole plasmodesmata and chloroplasts.</p>

<p>However they have some apparent differences. The cell membrane also called the plasma membrane is a thin layer that surrounds the cytoplasm of all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells including plant and animal cells. The DavsonDanielli model or paucimolecular model was a model of the plasma membrane of a cell proposed in 1935 by Hugh Davson and James Danielli.

<p>Cell walls are made up of carbohydrates such as cellulose hemicellulose and pectin and a complex organic polymer called lignin. Plant cells are eukaryotic cells present in green plants photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom PlantaeTheir distinctive features include primary cell walls containing cellulose hemicelluloses and pectin the presence of plastids with the capability to perform photosynthesis and store starch a large vacuole that regulates turgor pressure the absence of flagella or centrioles.
