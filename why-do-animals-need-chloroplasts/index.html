<p>Plant cells have mitochondria and chloroplasts an organelle that uses photosynthesis to produce energy. Plants usually get the light they need from the SunBut they can also grow in artificial light. You might think at first that its green because it wants to absorb and use green light. Photosynthesis is the primary means by which plants get their energy.</p>
