<p>Its not just used for seasonal bread that can of pumpkin is good year-round. I like to use Turbinado or Demerara sugar but regular granulated sugar will also work. Light brown sugar and granulated sugar. Its a perfect cake for Christmas. Pumpkin Coffee Cake By Hi Sugarplum Via Flickr Pumpkin Coffee Cakes Coffee Cake Pumpkin Recipes.</p>
