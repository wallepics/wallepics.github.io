<p>They are semi-permeable membrane covering the cell. The cell membrane is a thin membrane that encases the cytoplasm of the cell and holds the cytoplasm as well as the cells organelles within it separating the interior of the cell from the outside environmentThe cell membrane is semi-permeable meaning that it allows certain substances to move into the cell while it keeps certain other substances out of the cell. A plant cell has a cell wall as well as a plasma membrane. They are the fluid bags which are in fewer numbers in animal cells as compared to plant cells.</p>

<p>Plant Cell Definition Plant cells which are the fundamental units of the members of the plant kingdom are eukaryotic cells. The cell membrane therefore has two key functions. In mature plant cells vacuoles tend to be very large and are extremely important in providing structural support as well as serving functions such as storage waste disposal protection and growth. Both plant and animal cells contain nucleus along with similar organelles. The cell wall is the outermost covering of plant cells.</p>

<p>The plant cell is rectangular and comparatively larger than the animal cell. For instance the roots of the plants help in the absorption of minerals and water. The cell membrane is a thin membrane that encases the cytoplasm of the cell and holds the cytoplasm as well as the cells organelles within it separating the interior of the cell from the outside environmentThe cell membrane is semi-permeable meaning that it allows certain substances to move into the cell while it keeps certain other substances out of the cell.

<p>The basic plant cell has a similar construction to the animal cell but does not have centrioles lysosomes cilia or flagella. The cell wall is present only in plants fungi and bacteria. Enclosed by this cell membrane are the cells constituents including cell organelles and jelly-like fluids called cytosols with water-soluble molecules such as proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates and substances involved in cellular activities.
