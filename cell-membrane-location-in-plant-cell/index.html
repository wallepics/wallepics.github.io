<p>The cell membrane has large content of proteins typically around 50 of membrane volume These proteins are important for the cell because they are responsible for various biological activities. Approximately a third of the genes in yeast code specifically for them and this number is even higher in multicellular organisms. The term is typically used for a secreted protein that remains associated with the cell eg. Freely permeable layer surrounding cell membrane. A biological membrane biomembrane or cell membrane is a selectively permeable membrane that separates cell from the external environment or creates intracellular compartmentsBiological membranes in the form of eukaryotic cell membranes consist of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded integral and peripheral proteins used in communication.</p>
