<p>The sun is the main source of energy for almost every living thing on Earth. So some animals have tough skin and some have really thick skin. It steals from algae so that it can become solar-powered. These compounds are used to provide both the carbon skeletons for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy that drives cellular processes. Chloroplasts help turn sunlight into food that can be used by the cell a process known as photosynthesis.</p>
