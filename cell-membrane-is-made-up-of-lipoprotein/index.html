<p>Nearly all globular proteins contain substantial numbers of α-helices and β-sheets folded into a compact structure that is stabilized by both polar and nonpolar interactions Fig. Endocytosis takes up particles into the cell by invaginating the cell membrane resulting in the release of the material inside of the cell. In this process the material to be ingested is progressively enclosed by a small portion of the plasma membrane which first invaginates and then pinches.

<p>The amphipathic nature of phospholipids is vital to the structure of a plasma membrane because in water phospholipids automatically become arranged with their hydrophobic tails facing each other and their hydrophilic heads. The cell membrane is also called the cytomembrane or plasma membrane.
