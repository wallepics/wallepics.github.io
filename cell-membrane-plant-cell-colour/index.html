<p>It is a selectively permeable membrane of the cell which is composed of a lipid bilayer and proteins. Some of the cell organelles are present in both the plant and animal cell which help them to do the basic cellular activities. Unlike animal cells plant cells have a cell wall surrounding the cell membrane. The article would explore every aspect of the topic plant cell vs animal cell and thus would be extremely beneficial for the students from the discipline of biology.
