<p>In cellular respiration reaction 36 molecules of ATP are produced in complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose. The mitochondria is an organelle with the main purpose of creating energy for the cell. The cells of animals plants and many bacteria need oxygen O 2 to facilitate energy transfer during cellular respirationIn these organisms the type of cellular respiration takes place is called aerobic respiration. Cellular respiration includes other complex reactions such as glycolysis aerobic respiration anaerobic respiration krebs cycle and electron transport chain.
