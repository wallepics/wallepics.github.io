<p><strong>Plants And Animals Difference</strong>, Fungal cells differ from plant cells in that they do not have chloroplasts and cannot carry out pho. Animals ingest eat food. Both plants and animals are living things which means that they are both made of cells both have DNA and both require energy to growApr 11 2018 What is the similarities between plants and animals.

<p>In plants mitosis occurs only in the meristem tissues. In plants the respiratory gases simply diffuse in and out of the cell by cell division whereas in animals there is gaseous transport of gases. The cells in multicellular organisms are grouped to perform functional units called tissues. These stages are prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase.</p>

<p>Lastly at a more detailed level there can be certain subtle differences. Types of Tissues Epithelial found in animal cells Lines and Protects the organs. It occurs in four stages same as animal mitosis. In both plants and animals miRNAs posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression through interactio. Plants are autotrophs whereas animals are heterotrophs.</p>
