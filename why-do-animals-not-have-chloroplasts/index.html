<p><strong>Why Do Animals Not Have Chloroplasts</strong>, Scientists suspect they use this to help them find prey or suitable habitats. To a much lesser degree pigments that color orange red and yellow are also present in leaves but they play a secondary role to chlorophyll. Both chlorophylls also absorb in the orange-red end of the spectrum with longer wavelengths and lower energy. Unlike prokaryotic cells DNA in animal cells is housed within the nucleusIn addition to having a nucleus animal cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles or tiny cellular structures that carry out specific functions necessary for normal cellular operation.</p>

<p>Since their initial uptake by a host cell these organelles have lost much of their own genomes and have become heavily dependent on proteins that are encoded by genes in the nucleus synthesized in the cytosol and then imported into the organelle. Shorter wavelengths with more energy do not penetrate much below 5 meters deep in sea water. Learn how special structures such as chloroplasts and cell walls create this distinction.
